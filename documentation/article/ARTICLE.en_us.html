  In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium.
  From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, vertical signage fills our cities, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up.
</p>
<p>
  Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage that stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, Bungee fonts were designed to be able to adapt to horizontal or vertical text, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.

 <h4>Bungee Tint</h4>
 <p>
  Bungee Tint stores seven color palette aternatives inside the font itself, so it is possible to create chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefuly Bungee Color will help designers and developers explore and expand upon what color fonts have to offer.

 <h4>The Bungee Super Family</h4>
 <p>
  In vertical type, the downward flow of text becomes more important than the proportions of any individual letter. Bungee’s was drawn with round and diagonal characters with straight sides (see O and A), which reinforces their verticality and creates words with well-defined left and right edges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seven variations are available within this display superfamily, including two Color fonts:
