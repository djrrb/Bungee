Testing
=======

We run the tests using `tox`. This can be installed as usual with `pip install tox`.

Without any options, `tox` will run the tests against the current python version where
`tox` itself was installed:

To run tests against a specific python version you can use the `-e` option followed by
a tox environment name. E.g. `-e py38` will run tests against Python 3.8.
For more info, check `tox`'s [documentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
